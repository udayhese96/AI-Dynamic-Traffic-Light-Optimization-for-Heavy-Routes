# AI-Dynamic-Traffic-Light-Optimization-for-Heavy-Routes

A smart AI-based solution for traffic management on routes with heavy traffic from different directions, featuring **real-time monitoring** and **adaptive traffic light timing** using deep learning and computer vision techniques.

---

## ðŸš¦ Project Overview

This system leverages artificial intelligence to **dynamically optimize traffic light control** at high-traffic intersections. The goal is to reduce congestion, improve traffic flow, and ensure the prioritization of emergency vehicles when detected.

While the full solution includes multiple components, this repository currently **focuses on**:
- Vehicle detection in real-time video
- Retrieving vehicle count and estimating traffic density
- Emergency vehicle detection
- Displaying detection results and vehicle count-based timing
